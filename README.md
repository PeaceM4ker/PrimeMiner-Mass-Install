1) First make sure you have the required dependencies, make sure python
is installed

2) Grab the Paramiko module by doing sudo apt-get install python-paramiko -y

3) Add the list of server ips you would like to install primeminer on to the
iplist.txt document (ensure that all these servers have the same password set
I have yet to add a function for password input, I will get around to this
when/if I have time. If security is an issue for you just change the password
yourself afterwards, the servers themselves hold no coins so it shouldn't be a
major worry)

4) Change the line in the pushit.sh script with password="[yourpassword]" to
the password you have chosen for your group of servers.

5) Run the pushit.sh script, sit back, laugh. 

6) Check back with github.com/Peacem4ker for more scripts coming soon! (easy 
server group management for primeminer and a more robust install script coming
soon!)

7) Donate!!! The more I get, the more time I can spend writing better scripts!
